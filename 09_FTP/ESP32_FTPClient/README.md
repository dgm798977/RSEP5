# Description
I use this client to write sensordata into a log file and to upload images for my rabbit-webcam.

I took the changes from ldab. Thank you very much for that. However, I want to keep the directory structure as simple as possible so that the examples can be executed without problems.

I also noticed some problems with my 8 month old espressif library. You need to update the library for the example to work.

# TODO
[ ] Better errorhandling

[ ] Less redundant code

[ ] Recursive folder delete

## Imageupload
* For the uploading example we will use the GitHub Octocat, which binary file is [here](./octocat.h):
